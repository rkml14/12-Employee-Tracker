Things I've learned:

- How to use mySQL, creating schema & seeding it
- How to create queries & joins 
- An awful lot of array mapping and using them in inquirer.prompts
- Using the 'when' in the Inquirer NPM library to create a press any key to continue for the user 
- Creating a clean quit from the application for the user
